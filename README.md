# Classify-Trips

This project uses data taken from http://archive.researchdata.leeds.ac.uk/57/7/Combined_Data.zip the leads data archieve. The data taken from the on-board CAN and has vehicle trips around 4 different routes. Similarly, it has a classification of the driving style for each trip into calm, normal and aggressive. 

The first part of this project looks to classify the trips into which route they took using a Keras CNN model to classify the timeseries features.
